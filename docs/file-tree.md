# File tree and release manifest

KOVA3 occupies two buckets: one for the open tier, which anyone may read, and
one for the controlled tier, which is readable only by applicants who hold an
active Data Use Agreement. Their layouts are given separately below.

## Open-tier bucket layout

```

The callability layer is a run-length-encoded allele-number track as
bgzip-compressed BED with a tabix index, plus a 1 kb binned Parquet summary;
see [methods.md](methods.md#callability).

> **TODO:** chrM is within the run's contig list (see
> [methods.md](methods.md#reference-genome)), but confirm the shard is
> non-empty before publishing it rather than shipping an empty file.

## Controlled-tier bucket layout

Readable only with credentials issued after an application is approved. The
per-sample manifest is the entry point: read-level format varies by sample, so
resolve availability from the manifest rather than by listing the bucket.

```
s3://kova3-controlled/
├── manifest/
│   ├── samples.tsv                    # One row per sample: cohort, formats held, object keys
│   └── samples.parquet
│
├── fastq/
│   └── <COHORT>/<SAMPLE>/             # Paired-end, gzip-compressed
│       ├── <SAMPLE>_R1.fastq.gz
│       └── <SAMPLE>_R2.fastq.gz
│
├── cram/
│   └── <COHORT>/<SAMPLE>/             # Aligned, coordinate-sorted CRAM 3.0 on GRCh38
│       ├── <SAMPLE>.cram              # Renamed at upload; see cohorts.md
│       └── <SAMPLE>.cram.crai
│
├── gvcf/
│   └── <COHORT>/<SAMPLE>/
│       ├── <SAMPLE>.g.vcf.gz
│       └── <SAMPLE>.g.vcf.gz.tbi
│
└── msvcf/
    └── release=v3.0.0/             # Genotyped multi-sample VCF, chromosome-sharded
        ├── kova3.chr1.vcf.gz
        ├── kova3.chr1.vcf.gz.tbi
        └── ...
```

A sample appears under `fastq/`, under `cram/`, or under both, depending on
what the contributing cohort holds. Every sample appears under `gvcf/`. Samples
from the National Integrated Bio-Big Data (KOBIC) cohort appear under `gvcf/`
only, because read-level data for that cohort are not redistributed. See
[cohorts.md](cohorts.md) for the per-cohort breakdown.

## Naming conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Release tag | `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` | `v3.0.0` |
| Release prefix | `release=<tag>` (Hive-style) | `release=v3.0.0` |
| VCF shard | `kova3.<contig>.sites.vcf.gz` | `kova3.chr7.sites.vcf.gz` |
| Contig naming | GRCh38, `chr`-prefixed | `chr1`, `chrX` |
| Partition keys | lowercase, `key=value` | `chromosome=chr1` |

Paths are **immutable once published**. A correction produces a new release
prefix; it never rewrites an existing one. This lets downstream pipelines pin a
release path and rely on it not changing underneath them. See
[versioning.md](versioning.md).

---

## Design decisions

**Individual objects, never archives.** Files are stored as individual S3
objects rather than in `tar` or `zip` bundles, so users can retrieve exactly
the shard or partition they need.

**Chromosome sharding.** A single genome-wide sites file would be awkward to
handle and would force clients to seek through an index covering the whole
genome. Per-chromosome shards keep index sizes small and let users fetch one
chromosome.

**`.tbi` indexes only.** `.tbi` cannot address positions beyond 2^29 bases, but
the longest GRCh38 contig, chr1, is 249 Mb, well inside that limit. Publishing
`.csi` alongside would add a second index for no additional reach.

**Sites-only VCF, not BCF.** BCF's size and parsing advantage comes from
per-sample genotype columns, which a sites-only callset does not have, so it
buys little here while costing the wide tool compatibility that bgzip-compressed
VCF has. Users who prefer BCF can convert locally with `bcftools view -Ob`.

**Top-level `data/`, `metadata/`, `docs/` prefixes with a README at the root.**
This follows the layout recommended in the AWS Open Data onboarding handbook,
so users arriving from the Registry of Open Data find a familiar structure.

## Release manifest

Every release publishes `metadata/release=v3.0.0/manifest.json` listing each
object with its size and checksum.

```json
{
  "release": "v3.0.0",
  "released": "TODO-YYYY-MM-DD",
  "reference_genome": "GRCh38",
  "n_records_contributed": 10988,
  "n_unrelated": null,
  "pipeline": {
    "joint_genotyper": "DRAGEN IGG TODO-version",
    "platform": "Illumina Connected Analytics"
  },
  "objects": [
    {
      "key": "data/release=v3.0.0/sites_vcf/kova3.chr1.sites.vcf.gz",
      "bytes": 0,
      "sha256": "TODO",
      "content_type": "application/gzip"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **TODO:** generate the manifest programmatically at export time rather than
> maintaining it by hand, and fill `n_unrelated` from the QC output.

### Verifying an object

```bash
# Every object carries a published SHA-256 checksum. Verify after download.
aws s3 cp --no-sign-request \
  s3://kova3-open/data/release=v3.0.0/sites_vcf/kova3.chr1.sites.vcf.gz .

sha256sum kova3.chr1.sites.vcf.gz
# Compare against the sha256 field for this key in manifest.json.
```

### Listing a release without downloading

```bash
# No AWS account or credentials are required.
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request \
  s3://kova3-open/data/release=v3.0.0/sites_vcf/
```
